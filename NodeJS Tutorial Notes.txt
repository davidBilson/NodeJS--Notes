Prerequisites
- Modern JavaScript ES6

ECMA - industry association dedicated to the standardization of information and communication systems
ECMAScript refers to the standard language while JavaScript is what we use in practice and builds on top of ECMAScript
ECMA-262 is the language specification
ECMAScript is the language that implements ECMA-262
JavaScript is basically ECMAScript at its core but builds on top of that
ES6 is the latest standard (Modern JavaScript)

JavaScript Engine
JS cannot be understood by the computer
JavaScript engine is a program that converts JavaScript code into machine code that allows a computer to perform specific tasks
JS Engines are typically developed by web browser vendors
JavaScript Engines
V8 - Open-source JavaScript engine developed by @Google for Chrome (https://v8.dev/docs)
SpiderMonkey - The JavaScript engine powering Mozilla Firefox
JavaScript Core - Open source JavaScript engine developed by Apple for Safari
Chakra - JavaScript engine for the original microsoft edge (latest version of edge uses v8)



Do web browsers interpret JavaScript directly?
Let's find out together...

When a page with JS code is loaded in a browser, the browser's JavaScript engine is responsible for interpreting and executing the JS code

Web browsers do not interpret JavaScript directly, JS engines are responsible for that and different browsers have their own in-built engines

Google Chrome => V8 engine (https://v8.dev/docs)
Safari => JavaScript Core (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/javascriptcore/)
Microsoft Edge (latest version) => V8 engine
Mozilla firefox => SpiderMonkey (https://spidermonkey.dev/docs/)

Understanding how JavaScript engines work and leveraging their capabilities is essential for web developers to create dynamic and interactive web experiences.

JavaScript Run Time
JS runtime is an environment which provides all necessary components
